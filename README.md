# PBPhys
PBPhys is a C library providing structures and functions to simulate system of moving particles in any dimension.

Each particle is represented by a Shapoid, with a speed and acceleration vector, a mass and a drag coefficient. Particles can be fixed. The PBPhys is defined as GSet of particles. The system can emulate or ignore attraction between particles, downward gravity (applied to the second component of vectors, to simulate earth attraction for example), drag force on particle, elastic collision between particles (considered as perfect spheres). The user can control the system's particle by position, speed or acceleration. The user can step the system by increment of time or until the next collision. The whole system and individual particles can be printed on a stream, saved/loaded in a file.
